My project is focused on developing a decentralized trade finance solution aimed at helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome the barriers posed by traditional trade finance systems. In conventional setups, SMEs often face high costs due to multiple intermediaries such as importers' banks, beneficiaries' banks, and other third-party institutions. This raises the cost of accessing finance and complicates the process.

To address this, my project uses the Stellar blockchain to eliminate the need for middlemen and streamline the transaction process through the use of smart contracts. The contracts can store funds in escrow and release them incrementally as shipments pass specific checkpoints, verified through IoT and GPS data. This allows more transparent and efficient tracking of funds based on the delivery of goods.
